## Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car
## travels down the interstate can be calculated with the following formula:
## Distance = Speed * Time
## A car is traveling at 70mph. Write a program that displays the following:
## The distance a car will travel in 6 hours
## The distance a car will travel in 10 hours
## The distance a car will travel in 15 hours

speed = 70
time1 = 6
time2 = 10
time3 = 15

distance1 = speed * time1
distance2 = speed * time2
distance3 = speed * time3

print("Distance 1 is", distance1,
      "\nDistance 2 is", distance2,
      "\nDistance 3 is", distance3)
