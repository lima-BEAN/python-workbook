# Driver's License Exam
# The local driver's license office has asked you to create an
# application that grades the written portion of the driver's
# license exam. The exam has 20 multiple-choice questions. Here
# are the correct answers:
# 1. A    2. C    3. A    4. A    5. D    6. B    7. C    8. A
# 9. C    10.B    11.A    12.D    13.C    14.A    15.D    16.C
# 17.B    18.B    19.D    20.A
#
# Your program should store these answers in a list. The program should
# read the student's answers for each of the 20 questions from a text
# file and store the answers in another list. After the student's answers
# have been read from the file, the program should display a message
# indicating whether the student passed or failed the exam. (Must correctly
# answer 15 out of 20 to pass) It should then display the total number of
# correct answers, total number of incorrect answers and a list showing
# the question numbers of the incorrectly answered questions
