## Write assignment statements that perform the following operations with the
## variables a, b, and c.
## a. Adds 2 to a and assigns the result to b
## b. Multiplies b times 4 and assigns the result to a
## c. Divides a by 3.14 and assigns the result to b
## d. Subtracts 8 from b and assigns the result to a

a = 0
b = 0
c = 0

# part a
b = 2 + a
print(b)

# part b
a = b * 4
print(a)

# part c
b = a / 3.14
print(b)

# part d
a = b - 8
print(a)
